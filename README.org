#+title: jazz

some daisy seed effect pedal firmware

run ~nix-shell~ to get dependencies. see [[https://github.com/glittershark/jazz/blob/main/shell.nix][shell.nix]] for a list of dependencies if
you are less of a nix weenie than i am

* building and testing

to build firmware blobs for all effects:

#+begin_src shell-session
$ make
#+end_src

to run tests:

#+begin_src shell-session
$ make test
#+end_src

note: cmake generates ~compile_commands.json~ in the build directory and creates a symlink in the project root for clangd/language server support.

* flashing to daisy seed

to flash a particular effect to a daisy seed (in reset mode!):

#+begin_src shell-session
$ make flash DIR=delay
#+end_src

* current effects

- [[https://github.com/glittershark/jazz/blob/main/src/delay/delay.cpp][delay]]: literally just a perfectly clean delay.
- [[https://github.com/glittershark/jazz/blob/main/src/reverse/reverse.cpp][reverse]]: a simple reverse delay.
- [[https://github.com/glittershark/jazz/blob/main/src/granular/granular.cpp][granular]]: weird semi-generative granular delay.
