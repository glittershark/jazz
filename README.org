#+title: jazz

some daisy seed effect pedal firmware

run ~nix-shell~ to get dependencies. see [[https://github.com/glittershark/jazz/blob/main/shell.nix][shell.nix]] for a list of dependencies if
you are less of a nix weenie than i am

to build:

#+begin_src shell-session
$ make
#+end_src

to flash a particular pedal to a daisy seed (in reset mode!):

#+begin_src shell-session
$ make flash DIR=delay
#+end_src

* current effects

- [[https://github.com/glittershark/jazz/blob/main/src/delay/delay.cpp][delay]]: literally just a perfectly clean delay with a little bit of feedback.
  can't be controlled.
